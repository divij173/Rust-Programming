# Explorer Mark Request

(You should put an [X] in boxes with completed features.
Lines starting with ">" are additional comments.)

[X] There is a player is displayed on the screen.

[X] The player can be moved by pressing keys
> You can use the Up/Down/Left/Right keys to move around. (CHANGE THIS LINE IF IT IS NOT CORRECT)

[X] When the player tries to move off the screen, the screen follows them.

[X] The viewport does not necessarily always move when the player does.

[X] There are at least 5 block types (i.e different coloured blocks).

[X] The layout of the map is specified by a file on the filesystem.

[X] There is a 'barrier' block. When the player attempts to pass through it, they cannot.

[X] There is a 'water' block. When the player walks through the 10th block in a row, they die and the game ends.

[X] There is a 'sign' block. When the player walks over the sign block, a specified message is shown.

[X] There are 'objects' in my game -- when a player walks over the object, it disappears.

[ ] There is a quests system in my game.
[X] The quests system is in a seperate module or crate to the game.

[ ] The first quest (walking over sand blocks) is implemented.
[ ] The 'q' key shows the progress of my user in this quest.

[ ] The second quest (collecting five objects of one type, then three of another)
[ ] The 'q' key shows the progress of my user in this quest.

[ ] The third quest (at least two of the three subquests) is implemented.
[ ] The 'q' key shows the progress of my user in this quest.

[ ] My quests system is designed to make it easy for a developer to add more quests.

## How to Run My Program

Assuming we have taken your crate, without any compilation; what commands will start the game?

> $ 6991 cargo run path/to/map.ron first_quest

For e.g. > $ 6991 cargo run ../maps/full_game.ron q1
As soon as the map loads, first Press 't' for the player to be displayed on the map.

## Design Excellence

During the assignment we make suggestions for "design excellence". Please list all those
things you did, and where we can find them in your program.
    -> if the player attempts to pass through the barriers then the area around the player becomes white, letting user know that it cannot pass
    -> the area around the player changes according to the background or different colored block types
    -> pressing 't' will make the player visible 
    -> pressing 'r' will reset the game from start
    -> viewport moves when player tries to go off screen
    -> pressing 'e' will end the game
    -> player starts with no background color to show the initial position of player

> - TODO

If you made any other design choices you think demonstrate an equivalent level
of design excellence, please list them below (including where to find them).
Note, we suggest you check with a tutor that your design is in fact excellent
before adding something below:

> - TODO

## Design Limitations

If you made any design decisions which you now regret making; but don't to go back and change them,
let us know here. You can make up your design marks by acknowledging up to 5 things you would do
differently now.
    -> changing the background color to red when player tries to pass the barriers.
    -> Making cinderblock a barrier so that player could not pass throught it.
